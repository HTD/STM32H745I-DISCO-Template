# STM32H745I-DISCO PROJECT TEMPLATE

*(c)2023 by CodeDog Sp. z o.o.*

This project is a pre-configured STM32H745I-DISCO board firmware
with some custom drivers, tools and code scaffolding added.

Intended use: testing STM32H745I-DISCO boards, starting new
STM32H745I TouchGFX based projects.

Middlewares and drivers belong to third-party organizations.

This project is a (working) code sample. It is not an official release.

## Disclaimer

The current version lacks the separate documentation for the added features.

the code is made for internal use.

## Custom add-ons

### Directories

- `Drivers/Custom/`
- `Process/`
- `Tools/`

## Configuration

The project has configured internal `eMMC` memory, `USB_OTG_FS`,
`USART3` as debug port, `USART1` as serial printer port.

See `User Constants` in `.ioc` file.

It also configures TIM7 as microtime timer (not used in this template)
and TIM17 as delay time (used by `delay_async` and `repeat_async` functions
of `tim_ex.h`).

The original template is modified by setting LCD backlight power
enable pin to LOW on pre-os initialization, and setting it back high
on main app process start.

`main_user.c` also contains `clearLTDCRam` function that clears
the frame buffer used by the LCD screen to remove random artifacts
at startup.

Both `eMMC` and `USB` file systems are initialized on startup.
When a USB disk is inserted, the file system present on its first
partition is mounted and `App::fsAvailableChanged` function is called.

Check the `Tools/FS.hpp` source for inline documentation of how
to read and write files using this tool.

(Using `FS` tool is optional, `FATFS` functions can be used directly.)

The file systems can be accessed in RAII-friendly way using the
`FS` utility present in `Tools` directory.

The `FATFS` middleware is configured to support ExFAT file system
and long file names up to 255 characters.

## Startup

When the application run, the `App::init` function is call from
`App_Task` function declared in code generated in the device
configuration (`.ioc`) file.

The demo initializes the additional timers, audio chip, tries
to mount the file systems, turns the LCD backlight power on
and plays a beep sound through the headphone output.

## GUI

The application has a basic testing GUI consisting of 2 screens
and a button on each screen to navigate between screens.
It allows testing if the TouchGFX module works properly.

## Toolchain / environment

This projects requires `TouchGFX Designer` in version `4.22.0`
or later, and `STM32CubeIDE` in version `1.13.0` or later.

Optionally, `Visual Studio Code` can be used for working with the code files.

Microsoft `C++` extension is required, also a ARM toolchain that can
be downloaded at:

https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads

It needs to be extracted to a local directory and the path should be
specified in line `3` of `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file.

## Project name customization

To change the project name in any TouchGFX project, the project's name
must be placed in several places, be sure to cover all of them:

- root directory name
- `.ioc` file name
- `CM7/TouchGFX/*.touchgfx.part` content:
  - `Application/Name` property value
  - `Application/ProjectFile` property value (with `.ioc` extension)
- `*.touchgfx` file name
- `*.touchgfx` file content (same properties as in `*.touchgfx.part` file)
- `STM32CubeIDE/.project` content:
  - `projectDescription/name` property value
  - `linkedResources` section, `link` item, name of `.ioc` file

The changes should be applied wheb the project is not open in neither
`TouchGFX Designer` nor `STM32CubeIDE`.

The project should be imported to a clean `STM32CubeIDE` workspace again after its name was changed
to avoid errors.

### CAUTION

DO NOT USE *RENAME* OPTION IN EITHER TOOLS TO RENAME THE PROJECT!

DOING SO WOULD BREAK THE PROJECT BEYOND REPAIR.
